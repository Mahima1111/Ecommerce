        <h2>Opportunities, Challenges, and What Lies Ahead</h2>
        <p class="author">By Mahima Vijayan | June 5, 2025</p>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved from theoretical research to practical applications that are transforming industries and societies. From healthcare and education to entertainment and autonomous vehicles, AI continues to revolutionize how we live and work.</p>

    <p>In the future, AI is expected to become even more integrated into daily life. With the rise of machine learning, natural language processing, and generative models, machines will not only assist but also understand and collaborate with humans in complex tasks.</p>

    <p>However, this progress also brings challenges. Ethical concerns, data privacy, job displacement, and algorithmic bias are important issues that need thoughtful regulation and transparent implementation.</p>

    <p>Looking ahead, a responsible and human-centered approach to AI development will be key. As technology grows smarter, so must our commitment to using it wisely and inclusively.</p>
