    <p>Web development has evolved significantly in the past decade. With advancements in frameworks, tools, and
      artificial intelligence, developers are now able to build applications faster and more efficiently than ever
      before.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence is starting to play a major role, from generating code snippets to testing and even
      designing user interfaces. Tools like ChatGPT are helping developers by automating repetitive tasks and providing
      real-time assistance.</p>

    <p>Looking ahead, we can expect web development to become even more accessible, with low-code and no-code platforms
      gaining popularity. However, a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will always remain valuable.</p>

    <p>Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, staying updated with the latest trends and technologies is
      key to success in this ever-evolving field.</p>
